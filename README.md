# ViewBindingExample

This is an example project that shows how you can implement view binding into your project.

It does not have any functionality as the main purpose is to show only how you can implement the view binding.
It contains:
  1) One Activity 
  2) Two Fragments as the there are two different ways to get the instance of the Binding class in your fragments:
     * <b>inflate()</b>
     * <b>bind()</b>
